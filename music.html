                    <article>While far from the most experimental piece of musical artistry that has ever been released, Radiohead's cult-classic <i>Kid A</i> is just experimental enough to be quite a trip and a sonic journey that you won't regret embarking on. There are many interpretations of the songs and even the overarching story presented, but that's a part of the fun: deciding for yourself what this bleak, electronic, absolutely <em>mindbending</em> project means to you.</article>

                    <article>With a cover that proclaims itself a "short film", Kendrick Lamar's <i>Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City</i> establishes an immediate expectation of a major focus on storytelling. Of course, telling a story through song, or even a concept album with an overarching narrative is far from a brand new concept, but Kendrick knows and embraces this fact. Just because a piece of media uses common tropes or cliche does not mean it is inherently of lower quality, and this album pulls off one the oldest cliches known to the music industry <em>so</em> extremely well, that it seems like the freshest idea of the century. The best stories have more value the more they are experienced, and Kendrick Lamar's sophomore album is among the higher echelons of this priveleged group despite the relatively unconventional way it is told.</article>

                    <article>Paramore frontwoman Hayley Williams has been an icon within the popular rock music scene well over a decade now after the breakout hit of the group's sophomore album <i>Riot!</i> in 2007, but as time went on, the group seemed to be bleeding members with the loss of guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro and bassist Jeremy Davis.
