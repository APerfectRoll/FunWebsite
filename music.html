                    <article>While far from the most experimental piece of musical artistry that has ever been released, Radiohead's cult-classic <i>Kid A</i> is just experimental enough to be quite a trip and a sonic journey that you won't regret embarking on. There are many interpretations of the songs and even the overarching story presented, but that's a part of the fun: deciding for yourself what this bleak, electronic, absolutely <em>mindbending</em> project means to you.</article>
