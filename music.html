                    <article>While far from the most experimental piece of musical artistry that has ever been released, Radiohead's cult-classic <i>Kid A</i> is just experimental enough to be quite a trip and a sonic journey that you won't regret embarking on. There are many interpretations of the songs and even the overarching story presented, but that's a part of the fun: deciding for yourself what this bleak, electronic, absolutely <em>mindbending</em> project means to you.</article>

                    <article>With a cover that proclaims itself a "short film", Kendrick Lamar's <i>Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City</i> establishes an immediate expectation of a major focus on storytelling. Of course, telling a story through song, or even a concept album with an overarching narrative is far from a brand new concept, but Kendrick knows and embraces this fact. Just because a piece of media uses common tropes or cliche does not mean it is inherently of lower quality, and this album pulls off one the oldest cliches known to the music industry <em>so</em> extremely well, that it seems like the freshest idea of the century. The best stories have more value the more they are experienced, and Kendrick Lamar's sophomore album is among the higher echelons of this priveleged group despite the relatively unconventional way it is told.</article>

                    <article>Paramore frontwoman Hayley Williams has been an icon within the popular rock music scene for well over a decade now after the breakout hit of the group's sophomore album <i>Riot!</i> in 2007 with chart-topping hits like "Misery Business" and "crushcrushcrush". Unfortunately, not all that long ago, the band went through a period where they were seemingly bleeding members. The loss of guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro, and bassist Jeremy Davis all happened prior to the year 2015. While Zac has since returned to the group, the other two members have not. During this strange time of membership limbo, even Hayley quit the band. Hayley has since returned to Paramore alongside Zac Farro on drums and new guitarist Taylor York, however she has since went on several solo ventures, likely in part due to her time away from the group. The first full-length solo album she released was 2020's <i>Petals for Armor</i>, a compilation of three "parts" that were initially released individually as EPs. A far cry from Paramore's early roots in pop-punk, pop-emo, and alternative rock, and still distinct from 2018's 80s dance-pop hit <i>After Laughter</i>, <i>Petals</i> is a deeply personal web of songs regarding abuse, trauma, and learning to heal all behind notably upbeat electronic instrumentals that accompany emotional vocal performances that range from rage in "Simmer", to pain in "Sudden Desire", to infectious joy in "Taken" and "Pure Love".  </article>
